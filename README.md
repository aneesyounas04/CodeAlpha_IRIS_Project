# My_Iris_Classification_Project
Developed by Anees Younas during my CodeAlpha internship. This project uses the Iris dataset to classify flower species with machine learning. Includes data preprocessing, visualization, and models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-NN, with accuracy evaluation. A great learning tool for ML beginners!s
